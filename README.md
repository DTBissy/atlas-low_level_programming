This project is going over Singly Linked Lists.
A Singly Linked List is understood (by me) as a Node that stores data as a chunk with apointer to another chunk contaning a pointer to guess what? ANOTHER chunk and so on.
a Struct nodes is a value of data and nodePtr pointing to the next node.
Task 0-print\_list has me write a function that prints all the elements of list\_t list.
